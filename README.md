# Hello there 👋

I'm a software developer, Bitcoin educator, and co-founder of [Bitcoin Paraguay](https://bitcoinparaguay.org). My mission is to help people gain more freedom in their lives, and most of the projects I work on are driven by this mission.

🌍  Digital nomad who ended up living in Paraguay 🇵🇾 most of the year... 😅
